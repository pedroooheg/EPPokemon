Beneficial effects are defined as those that are positive for the user, such as: Non-beneficial effects, that Sheer Force will not activate for, include: If the user is holding a Life Orb and uses an attack that activates Sheer Force , it will not receive the 10% damage from Life Orb , but it gets boosts from both Life Orb and Sheer Force (total of 69% base power increase).

Serene Grace does not affect status moves or the Pokémon's critical hit ratio. Shadow Ball normally has a 20% chance of lowering Special Defense; with Serene Grace it is boosted to a 40% chance.
